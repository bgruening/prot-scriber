# Prot Scriber

Assigns short human readable descriptions to query biological sequences using references. For this, it consumes sequence similarity search (Blast or Diamond) results in tabular format.

## Implementation

This branch `faba-analysis` is based on the git branch `evaluation_R`.

## Annotation for Faba

This branch `faba-analysis` is just a temporary solution to enable annotation of the Faba query proteome with the current `R` implementation. At the time of writing and using this branch on the Faba query proteins, the `Rust` version of prot-scriber was not yet finished.
